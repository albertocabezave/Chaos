# Objectives:
​Research of Computational Foundations: 

Investigation and validation of the fundamental computational principles (Hardware Clocks, Monotonicity, and OS Scheduling) that justify and validate the proposed architecture.

​Ensuring Determinism: Guaranteeing that the simulation yields identical results across different hardware environments by isolating the logic from the system clock.

​Numerical Stability via Fixed Timestep: Implementing a robust update loop that prevents mathematical divergence in high-intensity simulations.

​Resource Optimization (CPU-Bound Performance): Designing a system that efficiently utilizes CPU cycles and minimizes jitter through an accumulator-based buffer.

​Industrial Portability: Validating that the architecture is suitable for critical applications (such as oil and gas or industrial modeling) where precision and long-term stability are mandatory.
